# Discord 101

Discord is a VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform. Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "servers".

## What will be covered

The idea behind this guide is to simplify the otherwise complicated elements of Discord. One such example is _Permissions._\

__However, no guide would be complete without coving the basics. So with that in mind, here is a non-exhaustive list.

### The Basics

* How to Install
  * Supported Operating systems
* How to join a server
* How to send:
  * Messages
  * Gifs
  * Images
  * Codeblocks
